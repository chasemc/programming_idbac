# Starting With Bruker Data



Bruker data used in this chapter is available here:
https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=7ce7c09a174545a4a7dfe80af25329b0


```{r}
library(here)
```


```{r}
bruker_data_path <- here::here("data",
                               "bruker_autoflex")
```


Data was acquired for both protein and small molecule data. Looking at the protein data we see that there is data from eight target spots (Spot C1, C10, etc):
```{r}
protein_path <- file.path(bruker_data_path,
                          "Protein_Data")

list.dirs(protein_path,
          recursive = FALSE,
          full.names = FALSE)
```


```{r}

```
