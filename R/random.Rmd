For a certain strain, see the acquisition date, method path, and the number of data points
```{r}

library(dplyr)
a <- "F:/Chase/Projects/R01/data"

                          a)[[1]]
b %>%
    tbl("IndividualSpectra") %>%
    filter(Strain_ID == "BS3610") %>% 
    filter(maxMass > 10000) %>% 
    select(c(acquisitionMethod, acquisitionDate,  number)) %>% collect ->p
